# AppGenius

This application is a to-list app written in SwiftUI. I have used ToDoIst todoist.com application's api's. I used third-party Moya and Alamofire libraries for networking. For storing data I used native library UserDefaults. This app has authorization from todoist api's, so you need todoist account or create it right from this app.

My application is written in MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). It has three tabs. Today where deadline of tasks from today or overdue located. Inbox where usually new tasks are located. And browse where you can go through projects, create new projects, and when tapping into it you can see project details, its sections and tasks. The app is very easy to use and is user-friendly.
